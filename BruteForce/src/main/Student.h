 * Description:
 * Student to project allocation requires a model of a student in such a manner
 * that allows for the system to allocate students based on target characteristics
 * and partitioning student populations into managed clusters. Unique identifiers
 * are captured, such as the StudentID, and relational attributes are defined, such
 * as the class # ClassID, that helps keep track of what projects are available
 * to each instance of a student. Each instance of a student represents
 * a real student seeking to matched up with the best project possible allowed.
